# cleanCalc
a very basic JS calculator, built with the goal of having a very clean UI and very clean code.
if you want a demo of it, you can just download it and run the HTML file

You can embed it in your website/html doc very easily with just one line:
`<iframe src="./cleanCalc.html" title="cleanCalc" width="240" height="365" style="border: none;"></iframe>`
(replace `./cleanCalc.html` with where you put the HTML file and what you rename it to, obviously)
