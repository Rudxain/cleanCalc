# cleanCalc
A very basic JS calculator, built with the goal of having a very clean UI and very clean code.
If you want a demo of it, you can just [download it](https://github.com/Rudxain/cleanCalc/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and open the HTML file

You can embed it in your website/html doc very easily with just one line:
```html
<iframe src="./cleanCalc.html" title="cleanCalc" width="240" height="365" style="border: none;"></iframe>
```
(replace `./cleanCalc.html` with the path and name (if you renamed) where you put the HTML file, obviously)
